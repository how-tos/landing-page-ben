                        <h3>How to change acoustic guitar strings.</h3>
                        <p>You'll first want to detune all of the strings so they're nice and wobbly, once they are, remove the strings from the tuners(be careful, the ends of the strings are pointy and can stick you if you're not careful!). Towards the bottom of the guitar on the 'bridge' you will see six white pegs which hold the strings down, using your guitar winder(a knife also works) pop off those pegs to completely remove the strings. Now that the strings are completely removed, get your new pack of strings and put the ball end to the hole where you just removed the peg, then close the peg down on the string, bring it up and tune for every string! Make sure you're in tune and you're good to go!</p>

                            <h3>How to properly hammer in a nail.</h3>
                            <p>While some may find this a rather simple task, the proper technique is often lost on lots of people. There's lots of people who routinely hurt themselves and theres a variety of reasons as to why that may be happening so here are some tips. Make sure you're always using your primary hand to hold the hammer as you will have far better accuracy with that hand. Also always be sure to line up your hit instead of just swinging wildly. Always be sure that you're holding the nail by the bass and not by the top, where you're finger is most vulnerable.</p>

                            <p>We all love our pets, sometimes to a fault. I've had more than one spoiled dog in my life who refuses to take his pill, I used to make them take it and feel bad about it later, but heres a tip I figured out so my dog takes the pill everytime! The oldest trick in the book, is also surprisingly one of the most effective. Dogs love cheese, don't ask me why, but they do, so a healthy amount of cream cheese surrounding the pill tends to work quite often! I usually just shove the pill right in the middle of the cream cheese! </p>

                            <h3>How to easily parallel park.</h3>
                            <p>We've all been there. The driving exam is coming up and you're still rusty on parallel parking. "Why would I ever need to use this, I live in a small town, I'll never need to parallel park in my life, WHY IS THIS REQUIRED FOR THE TEST!". First of all, relax, it's not that big of a deal. First you line up your bumper with the car in front of you, then you fully turn your steering wheel until your bumper is against the curb, then turn the wheel the opposite direction, and voila, its simple as that! Be sure to use your mirrors for guidance!(Bonus points if your car has one of those cameras in the back). </p>
