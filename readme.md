Welcome to the landing page for How-To by Benjamin Lopez!
Here is a quick rundown of everything you need to know about the code.

HTML

There are two html pages though you can easily add more as the project sees fit, index.html is the main home landing page, whereas about.html is the html code for the about page.

LESS
I went with the LESS preprocessor for all of the styling and there is a LESS folder containing everything you need in order to modify everything.

JS
There is currently only one bit of JS for the hamburger menu that appears on mobile only titled 'menu.js' however once again there is plenty of room and flexibility to add more JS if needed.
